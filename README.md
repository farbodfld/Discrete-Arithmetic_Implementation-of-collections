# Discrete-Arithmetic_Implementation-of-collections
In this question, we want to implement mathematical sets. Write a program that works according 
to the following input and output.

In the first line of the input, you will receive a number n, which represents the number of 
members of the first set, in the second line, n is an integer that is the members of the first set 
(the entries are not necessarily different from each other), in the third line, you will receive a 
number m, which represents the number of members of the set. is second, and on the last line 
of input you are given m integers that are members of the second set.

In the output, first display all the subsets of both sets as in the output (in the order shown in the 
output), then display the members A⋃B, A⋂B, A-B and A△B in the order of the sample output. 
P.N.: The output of the subsets is in numerical order
